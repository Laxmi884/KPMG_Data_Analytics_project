# KPMG_Data_Analytics_project
Creating a report for a company from the given data indicating which customers they can target.
This project is a part of Virtual internship. This project is divided into 3 parts. 
The cleaning part and all the data manipulation of data given is done in Alteryx. The workflow is attached having .yxmd extension.

Part 1 of project: 

Task Background: Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team.Smith discusses KPMG’s expertise in this space (you can read more here). In particular, he speaks about how the team can effectively analyse the datasets to help Sprocket Central Pty Ltd grow its business. Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. However, in order to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director for some ideas and she advised that “the importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth.”
The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:
Customer Demographic 
Customer Addresses
Transactions data in the past 3 months
You decide to start the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.

Task: Draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues. Refer to ‘Data Quality Framework Table’ and resources below for criteria and dimensions which you should consider.

Part 2 of project:

Background of task: Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation. The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is sure that, if correctly analysed, the data would reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.

Task: For context, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is a long-standing KPMG client whom specialises in high-quality bikes and accessible cycling accessories to riders. Their marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behaviour. 

Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, please recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation. 

In building this recommendation, we need to start with a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach which we will be taking. The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.

Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off. Please advise what steps you would take. 

Please ensure your PowerPoint presentation includes a detailed approach for our strategy behind each of the 3 phases including activities involved in each - i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off.

Part 3:
Please develop a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. Display your data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard (see tools/references for assistance).  Maximum of 3 dashboard views/tabs, creativity in layout and presentation is welcome.
